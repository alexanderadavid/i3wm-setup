# Ubuntu Setup

Alex's custom Ubuntu setup. Uses a productive and aesthetically pleasing combination of i3wm, lightdm, pywal, compton, and other fun stuff.

## Instructions

1. Pull this down and copy its contents to your home directory. Make sure contents of subdirectories overwrite contents on your local machine.
2. run `sh setupUbuntu.sh` as root

### TODO
